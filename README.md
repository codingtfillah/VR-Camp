To update the audio, replace all of the mp3 files in the audio folder with the corresponding new mp3. Make sure the file name is exactly the same (including capitalization), and make sure the file is mp3 not m4a.
To update the 3d images, replace all the JPG files in the img folder with the corresponding new JPG. Again, make sure the file name is exactly the same.

Make sure not to change anything in the js folder or the index.html file, or else it will probably stop working. If you want to change the posters for whatever reason, just replace it with an image of the same aspect ratio as a png with the exact same name as the corresponding old one.

Hope this helps!
